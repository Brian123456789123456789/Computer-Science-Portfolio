<h4>I am Brian I am in ninth grade at Everest Public Highschool.I have been to Mexico,Oregon,and California.I enjoy nature although i prefer to be indoors.
My favorite Quote from Mission Impossible: 3 (A movie)is "Do you have a wife?... Do you have a girlfriend?... I'm just gonna hurt her."-philip seymour hoffman. This quote for me is funny. I heard this quote because i saw Mission Imposible:3.
My favorite T.V. show is Adventure Time.I like Adventure time because its pretty funny and has some interesting quotes like "bad biscuits make the baker broke bro"-Jake The Dog. 
I enjoy playing video games like Counter-Strike:Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. Theses games are fun for me. I got into them because my friend introduced me to them and i enjoyed playing them.My favorite asspect of those games are how you can use strategy to win.
